Defect: Messages routed through environment may not reach their destination.
Number: 1
Name of tester: Cameron Dashti
Date: April 6, 2013
Resolution: The use of LinkedQueues is not thread safe and trying to add a message to the 
			Queue may be preempted. To resoleve this, use a LinkedBlockingQueue to ensure threads don't
			interrupt eachother when trying to write and read their inboxes.

Defect: PLC class is loaded at run time and not dynamically.
Number: 2
Name of tester: Cameron Dashti
Date: April 20, 2013
Resolution: Use the 'Class' class to dynamically load a class file. The PLC class should have some
			means of signaling to the system that it is in fact a PLC program.

Defect: Setting the crossing to be enabled for 30 seconds will block if use Thread.sleep().
Number: 3
Name of tester: Cameron Dashti
Date: April 21, 2013
Resolution: Don't sleep the thread when enabeling a crossing because this will block other
			threads. Using a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor will allow the track controller to
			schedule a new thread that will run after a delay and will disable the crossing.

Defect: Stuck in infinite loop while waiting for PLC to load.
Number: 4
Name of tester: Cameron Dashti
Date: April 21, 2013
Resolution: Polling the GUI if the PLC is loaded seems to get always be false. Putting an empty
			print statement will casue the infinite loop to no longer get stuck.		

Defect: Toggeling of switches creates errors.
Number: 5
Name of tester: Cameron Dashti
Date: April 25, 2013
Resolution: Check both ends of the block if they are null. If not null, check which end is a switch.
			Get the current switch state and toggel the state.
